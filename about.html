          <br /><br />
          I currently live here in Laguna, Philippines. I studied Bachelor of
          Science in Computer Science. For the past four years of studying
          Computer Science, I was interested in the field of designing and
          developing websites and system. I love to see designs and I love to
          convert my ideas into reality. I want to pursue my career in designs
          and development of websites and system and practice my skill in the
          industry.<br /><br />
          In my early experience as an On-The-Job Trainee when I am Senior High
          School and College and, I was involved in communicating with different
          people, answering calls, accomplishing tasks, working with the team,
          and work independently. In my experience as an On-The-Job Trainee at
          DOST-FPRDI, I was assigned a role as a Frontend Developer. I am
          responsible for designing and developing the user interface (UI) of
          the system and preparing technical documentation. Being an OJT, I was
          also responsible to assist other employees in terms of technical
          aspects, attending seminars, answering calls and preparing weekly
          accomplishment reports.
          <br /><br />
          Currently, as a UI/UX Designer at Daily Social Studio for nearly 6
          months, I have had the opportunity to hone my skills in various areas
          of design. My primary focus has been on UX research, where I have
          gained valuable experience in conducting competitors analysis and
          creating user flows. In addition to that, I have also dabbled in game
          design, web design, app design, and WordPress design, which have
          provided me with a diverse range of design challenges and allowed me
          to expand my skillset. In my role, I have been involved in designing
          and prototyping various web and mobile applications, working closely
          with developers to ensure that the final product meets the needs of
          our users. I have also contributed to the development of our company's
          WordPress website, creating custom designs and implementing them using
          WordPress themes and plugins. Overall, working at Daily Social Studio
          has allowed me to gain practical experience in various aspects of
          design and has provided me with opportunities to work on exciting
          projects with a talented and dedicated team. I look forward to
          continuing to develop my skills as a UI/UX Designer and contributing
          to the success of the company.
